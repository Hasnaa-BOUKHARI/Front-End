                    s a 1999 American supernatural horror film written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan. The film tells the story of Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment)
                    , a troubled, isolated boy who is able to see and talk to the dead, and an equally troubled child psychologist named Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis)
                    who tries to help him. The film established Shyamalan as a writer and director, and introduced the cinema public to his traits, most notably his
                    affinity for surprise endings.
